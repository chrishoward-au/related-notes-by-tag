# Related Notes by Tag - Obsidian Plugin

A productivity tool for Obsidian users who want to easily discover related content in their knowledge base through tag-based connections.

Displays a list of notes in the right sidebar that contain the same tags as the currently active note, effectively showing "related notes by tag."

## Current Status

This plugin is currently in **Phase 3: Polish**.

- Monitor the currently active note in the editor
- Extract all tags from the current note
- Search for other notes containing those same tags

- Update the display automatically when switching between notes

### Refinement (Phase 2)

- Add sorting options
- Implement settings panel
- Add filtering capabilities
- Optimize performance for large vaults

### Polish (Phase 3 - In Progress)

- Improve UI with better formatting and icons
